Once upon a time, @mrrrgn started a little enterprise called nine-things. Today, it's just a test
organization for https://github.com/mrrrgn/taskcluster-github 

# taskclusterrc

The little .taskclusterrc file here is like a more generic travis.yml file - it's used to configure
taskcluster tasks any which way you like. Best of all, thanks to taskcluster's architecture, we can 
support running jobs on *any* platform: even Plan9!
